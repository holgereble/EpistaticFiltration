# EpistaticFiltration - an Extension for polymake

## Purpose
This extension for [polymake] (https://www.polymake.org) was developed to compute, visualize and analyze epistatic filtrations over various datasets.

## Datasets
In the data folder there are several filtrations of datasets which we investigated in our articles. 

## Usage
First clone the git into a directory. Then open polymake and
```
import_extension("/path/to/git/folder");
```
For examples how to compute things with this extension, please have a look at the jupyter notebook `EpistaticFiltration.ipynb` in the jupyter folder.
